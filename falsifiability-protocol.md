# Black Belt OS™ – Falsifiability Protocol

The Black Belt OS™ (BB-OS) declares that every functional human organization inevitably operates through **exactly nine essential processes**.  
Following Popper’s principle of falsifiability, the hypothesis is scientific only if we provide clear conditions under which it can be refuted.

## Refutation Criteria

**C1. A Tenth Essential Process**  
- If someone demonstrates a genuinely essential process not covered by the existing nine, and not reducible to them, the hypothesis fails.  

**C2. Violation of Irreducibility**  
- If an organization can sustain itself without one of the nine processes, the hypothesis fails.  

**C3. Failure of Portability**  
- If the model cannot provide superior clarity across at least 7–8 diverse contexts (e.g., startup, tribe, NGO, empire, DAO), the hypothesis fails.  

**C4. Failure of Independent Reproducibility**  
- If independent evaluators, trained in the taxonomy, cannot reach ≥80% agreement when mapping functions to the nine processes, the hypothesis fails.  

**C5. Failure of Practical Utility**  
- If adoption of the OS does not lead to statistically significant improvements in pre-registered metrics (e.g., lead-time, churn, margin, cost of coordination), the hypothesis fails.  

## Testing Protocol

1. **Define the scope** of the organization to be analyzed.  
2. **Conduct OS Diagnosis**: list all functions currently in place.  
3. **Map functions** into one of the nine essential processes.  
4. **Register intersections** where functions overlap.  
5. **Compare evaluators** to measure convergence.  
6. **Pre-register results** in open science repositories (OSF, Zenodo, SSRN, arXiv).  
7. **Replicate longitudinally** after 2–4 operational cycles.  

## Instruments

- **OS Diagnosis Form** (living document).  
- **Comparative checklists**: inspired by EOS, Scrum, Lean, BSC, etc., but always mapped into the nine.  
- **Convergence spreadsheet**: evaluator agreement.  
- **Key metrics**: lead-time, NPS/CSAT, churn, margin, ROI, coordination costs.

⚔️ **Clause of Scientific Integrity**  
Until one of the five criteria is violated, the BB-OS remains robust as a universal structural hypothesis.
